<h1>Sexual Harassment in the United States Work Force</h1>

<p id="byLine">By: Jessica Cattanach</p>

<p>Title VII prohibits any discrimination based on sex, and includes a wide variety of sex-based discrimination. Sexual harassment, sexual assualt, pregnancy, gender identity, and more are all protected under the title. Of over 98 thousand general harassment charges, over 27 thousand were for sexual harassment. An overwhelming majority of these charges are filed by women, at 62.2%. Millions of dollars have gone into "compensation" in these cases. We must do better in combatting this phenomenon and prevent it instead of compensating afterwards.</p>

<a href="https://www.eeoc.gov/data/enforcement-and-litigation-statistics-0">Source: U.S Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Table E2c. Title VII Sexual Harassment Charge Receipts and Resolutions by Type of Resolution FY 2010 - FY 2023</a> 

<p>The above data shows the amount of charges recorded per year. There is a noticable dip around 2020-2021, which is when the COVID-19 pandemic led to mass amounts of people working from home. This period of working from home, while not completely eliminating sexual harassment, lowered the amount.</p>

<p>The numbers shown above do NOT include money earned from litigation. Instead of large amounts of monetary compensation, companies need to take action against their employees found guilty of sexual harassment. The elimination of sexual harassment will not only create a better work environment, but save companies money, a sad factor in their motivation to act.</p>
